          100 years of combined legal experience. We thoroughly analyze each and
          every detail to craft solid legal strategies that are aimed at results —
          while remaining well-grounded in the law. Our attention to detail has
          helped not only to achieve results, but also to shape and define the
          law.

            <h1>Client Testimonials</h1>
            <p>The mantle of your profession may be worn by all who pass the bar, but not so the crown. Your communication of empathy and sense of immediacy brought great comfort to me. Thank you for the extension of the courtesy and, more so, for the connection. –J.H.</p>
            <p>“You are an “unsung hero”!!  I appreciate everything that you do . . .”  S.L.</p>
            <p>“John-Thank you for taking the time to talk with me earlier this week!  I just wanted to send you and your staff this gift to show my appreciation.  Sandra B., (business owner).”</p>
            <p>“I wanted to thank you for giving your afternoon to us and appreciate your honest input. We talked on the way home and asked the insurance company to settle for what you recommended. They Agreed. We all signed and it was over. I appreciate you sharing your time and Knowledge.” -Judy</p>
            <p>“Please accept my belated thank you for your generous blessings of advice. Most recently dealing with my (now repaired) car. Always great to talk to you. Thanks again and all the best!” -BL</p>
            <p>“Thank you for your outstanding efforts. It was appreciated!” -Fallsington Grant HOA</p>
            <p>“The familiar saying is, ‘No good deed goes unpunished!.’ Well, with respect to you and, from my standpoint, you’re without recognition for the work you do. I want to say ‘thanks for all that you do’ it hasn’t gotten by me!” -Sidney</p>
            <p>“I can’t thank you enough for your help. When I first asked for your legal advice, I only expected you to tell me my options, but you went far above and beyond my expectations without me even requesting. You’ve shown me a prime example of what it means to be a good man and brother. I hope that I can continue to show this sort of kindness and generosity towards my brothers, family, and strangers alike. Thanks again for your help and generosity.” -Derek</p>
            <p>“Thank you for sharing your time and expertise with us today.” -Angie On Behalf of the Cincinnati Paralegal Association</p>
            <p>“To me, you are not the “unsung hero”! Thank you for all of your great work. You have gifted all you can by your kind efforts.” -Sid</p>
            <p>“Thank you for your wonderful kindness and strong character during our family’s difficult time. You are a blessing to us and we are very grateful!” -Tom and Maria</p>
            <p>“On behalf of the Butler County Bar Association, I want to thank you for your presentation at the Ethically Marketing Your Law Practice seminar. We received positive feedback from our attendees who found your presentation both interesting and informative. We look forward to having you speak at future BCBA seminars and/or events. Again, we thank you and appreciate your time and expertise” -Melanie, BCBA Executive Director, 6/27/2019</p>
            <p>“Thanks for saving my ass” -Pat K</p>
            <p>“With appreciation for your important contribution to the health and safety of all Minnesotans”  -Rudy Perpich, Governor of the State of Minnesota</p>
            <p>
                “I attended Attorney Phillips presentation last Thursday at the Butler County Bar Association, “Ethically Marketing Your Law Practice.” I wanted to let Attorney Phillips know that I thought he gave a great presentation. Not only did I learn a lot, but more importantly, I think, I walked away knowing that what I am doing in my own immigration law practice is not in violation of any ethical rules or regulations. Peace of mind is invaluable.  Thank you for taking the time to give the presentation!”   -Gabriela</p>
            <p>You showed a great depth of knowledge and also the caring to weigh my alternative options with me. I can certainly understand why you are thought so highly as a lawyer —-and maybe even more importantly, in my opinion, as a person.  – Steven D.</p>
